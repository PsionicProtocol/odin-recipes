# odin_recipes
This is my first project made for TOP as a part of their foundations course.
The objective is to build upon my HTML knowledge by creating a basic recipe website
By this project's completion, I will have demonstrated my understanding with the following:

* Basic elements such as ol, a, and image
* The use of Git and Github and best commit message practices
* Boilerplates and what the elements nested in the head element control
